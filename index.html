He grew up during the golden age of Pericles' Athens, served with distinction as a soldier, but became best known as a questioner of everything and everyone.</figcaption>

		<p>Within every caterpillar there is a butterfly, and the caterpillar becomes the butterfly through it's own process. Unlike a butterfly, a child will not reach their highest expression without the right tutelage, guidance and support. For this reason, where possible, it is good if they can experience mentorship.</p>
